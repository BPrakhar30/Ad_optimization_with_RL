**Ad Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning**

**Project Overview**

This project explores the use of Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to optimize the placement of ads on websites. By predicting the optimal positioning of ads to maximize user engagement (clicks), the model aims to address the limitations of traditional ad placement strategies, such as fixed or random positioning, which can lead to ad blindness or inefficiency.

**Why Reinforcement Learning?**

Data Constraints: Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that require extensive data, features, and hyperparameter tuning, our approach leverages reinforcement learning which can operate effectively with limited data.

Model-Free: Q-Learning doesn't require knowledge of all possible states in advance, making it suitable for dynamic environments like web pages where ad positions and user interactions can vary widely.

Efficiency: Q-Learning is intuitive and converges faster, providing a practical solution for real-world applications.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about ad clicks across different positions on a web page. Each row represents a state with 10 possible ad positions, annotated with 1 (clicked) or 0 (not clicked).

**Kaggle Dataset: Ads CTR Optimisation**

**Implementation Highlights**

Environment Setup: The dataset is treated as the environment, with each row representing a unique state in the ad placement space.

Q-Learning: Implements Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy for ad placement based on user interactions.

Max Policy: Explores a policy to display ads where they are most likely to be clicked, based on historical data.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in optimizing ad placements without requiring extensive datasets or predefined features. By adapting to user behavior, the Q-Learning model provides a scalable solution for improving ad visibility and engagement.
